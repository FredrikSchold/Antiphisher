# Antiphisher


    Synopsis

Script to send fake logins to fake loginforms. 

    Description

This script is written to counter the big amount of phishing-sites out there. If one of your users or yourself accidently tries to login to a fake loginform you can use this script to send fake login information to the fake loginform. 
This to hide your information in the mass of other fake information.
Ofcourse the first step should be to change your password if you sent real login information to a maliscious site.

    Also I dont condone using this on nonmaliscious sites as some kind of spam! This is only to counter phishing!

    Inputs 
This script is using apmodule.psm1. Make sure you dont change directory structure because then the script wont find the module.
We are using the following JSON-files to fetch different data, such as @domains.com, names, passwords and more - you can change directory but then you need to specify the paths in the module.
